  "summary": "The most likely first component of cells to exist would have been the cell membrane. The membrane was just a thin layer surrounding an empty cell interior. However, that ancient cell membrane is almost indistinguishable from those of the cells in our bodies. Topic 2.3 is about the cell membrane and all the unique bits and bobs that make it work.",
