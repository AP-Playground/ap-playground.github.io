  "summary": "As previously discussed in topic 2.4, cell membranes don't let most things go through them. This has benefits to the cell, but also several downsides, the largest being that larger, useful, molecules (like glucose) cannot enter the cell. Topic 2.5 is about how the cell circumvents these problems.",
