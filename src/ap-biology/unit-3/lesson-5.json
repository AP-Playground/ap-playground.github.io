  "summary": "In the previous lesson, you learned how plants use photosynthesis to get and store energy. Once that energy is stored (typically in the form of glucose), eukaryotes have several ways to turn it back to usable energy (ATP). Topic 3.5 explains both the aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen) ways cells produce ATP.",
