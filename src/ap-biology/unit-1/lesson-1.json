  "summary": "This lesson has to do with an essential component of life: water. Topic 1.1 covers the structure of water and the properties which make it such an important and life sustaining molecule. Although this topic isn't mentioned often by College Board it covers many essential concepts for the rest of the course. It is highly recommended that you go over chemistry fundamentals in Unit 0 before starting this lesson.",
