  "summary": "Although this course primarily covers biology, it is impossible to go through it without some knowledge of chemistry. The course spends most of its time covering the cellular level of an organism. At this small scale, we discuss individual molecules and their structure and function. Chemistry is needed to understand these molecules' dynamics. This lesson does not exist in the official AP Biology curriculum, but we have added it here as a helpful resource.",
