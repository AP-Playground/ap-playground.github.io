  "summary": "From the mid-1700s to 1980 CE, Europe and the Americas experienced rapid change and innovation that involved considerable cultural, technological, and stylistic shifts. Art was created and existed in the context of dramatic events such as industrialization, urbanization, economic upheaval, migration, and war. In the mid-19th century, advances in technology hastened the development of building construction, including skyscrapers as an innovative architectural form. This unit allows students to make connections between these contexts and the art that emerged from them with a focus on the influence of interactions between and among cultures, the effects of technology, and significant shifts in purposes, functions, and audiences for art.",
