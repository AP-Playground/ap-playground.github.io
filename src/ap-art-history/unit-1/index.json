  "summary": "The discipline of art history examines art and the practices of art making, and explores how theories and interpretations of art develop and change over time. Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting are important parts of understanding art and art making in Unit 1. The influence of these factors can be seen in early works from throughout the world that share certain features, including a concern with the natural world and humansâ€™ place within it.<br><br>The analysis and interpretations of art from this period are especially important, as little-to-no written evidence exists for such early works, and art historians develop theories in collaboration with social and physical scientists to understand art historical developments.",
